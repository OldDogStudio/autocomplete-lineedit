# LineEdit AutoComplete Redot 4.3 - v1.3.0

## Safety Improvements & Bug Fixes

This release focuses on improving code safety and preventing potential crashes in edge cases.

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed potential crash in `refresh_nodes()`** when setting focus neighbors if the LineEdit node is not in the scene tree
- **Added defensive checks in `_input()`** to prevent crashes if the LineEdit is freed or removed from the scene tree during keyboard navigation
- **Improved node reference handling** by using direct LineEdit references instead of relying solely on NodePath lookups, making the addon more resilient to scene tree reorganization

### Internal Improvements
- Added validation to ensure LineEdit nodes exist and are valid before accessing their properties
- Improved code safety throughout the codebase to handle unexpected scene configurations
- Better handling of edge cases where UI components may be in transitional states

### Technical Details
For developers extending this addon:
- `CompleteMenu` now stores both a direct reference and NodePath to the associated LineEdit
- Focus neighbor assignments now validate node existence before attempting to set relationships
- Input handling validates the LineEdit state before processing keyboard navigation
